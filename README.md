# GBE-Plus-Projects
These are graphics packs for the handheld nintendo emulator GBE-Plus by shonumi https://github.com/shonumi/gbe-plus

Although I will try my best to support all rom versions, please use the reccomended rom. 

To use put them in your /data/Load folder and select your manifest text file in paths.
All packs will use a CGFX scale of 6x unless otherwise stated, and will be compatable with the current release

currently updating for 1.2 in the next few days
